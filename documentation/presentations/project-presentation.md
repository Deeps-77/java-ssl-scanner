## Slide 2: Problem Statement

### The Challenge: SSL/TLS Security Vulnerabilities in Java Applications

**Critical Security Issues:**
- 🔴 **60% of Java applications** contain SSL/TLS vulnerabilities
- 🔴 **Weak cipher suites** still widely used (RC4, DES)
- 🔴 **Certificate validation bypassed** in development code
- 🔴 **Protocol downgrade attacks** (SSLv3, TLS 1.0)
- 🔴 **Runtime vulnerabilities** missed by static analysis

**Real-World Impact:**
- Data breaches due to man-in-the-middle attacks
- Compliance violations (PCI DSS, HIPAA)
- Financial losses from security incidents
- Reputation damage from vulnerability disclosures

## Slide 3: Current Analysis Gaps

### Why Existing Tools Fall Short

**Static Analysis Limitations:**
- ❌ Cannot detect runtime SSL/TLS behavior
- ❌ Misses dynamic cipher negotiation issues
- ❌ Limited context awareness
- ❌ High false positive rates

**Dynamic Analysis Challenges:**
- ❌ Complex setup and configuration
- ❌ Limited SSL/TLS specific detection
- ❌ Performance overhead concerns
- ❌ Incomplete vulnerability coverage

**The Need: Comprehensive Multi-Modal Analysis**
